    <h1>JQuery Exercise 1</h1>
    <p>
        Add another paragraph element to this page with some text in it.  Create
        a button.  Insert jQuery logic into this page to wire up a click handler
        for the button that will change your new paragraph's text to some other
        text content.
    </p>
    <p>
        BONUS: use jQuery to change the color of the header to some other color
        when the button is clicked.
